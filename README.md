TransportDroidIL
================

TransportDroidIL is a neat little android app for getting bus & train times for
Israel. It was written by Ohad Lutzky <ohad@lutzky.net>, with many patches
by Haggai Eran <haggai.eran@gmail.com>.

The app itself is in the `TransportDroidIL` project. The `TransportDroidILTest`
project contains functioning unit-tests (yay!), which must be in a separate
project in the Android SDK.

How it works
------------

TransportDroidIL receives user input and sends it to either
[Egged](http://egged.co.il) or the [Ministry of Transport](http://bus.gov.il)
sites, using the free-text engine there. Since the sites are nearly identical
in implementation, it's not a lot of extra work. Any information reported by
the application comes from those two sites, so we support whatever queries they
do. Also, for convenience, there's a history-based autocompleter.

Realtime bus location updates are available for the following companies:

 * [Nazeret United Bus Services](http://nazareth-unbs.com)
 * [Nazeret Transport and Tourism](http://ntt-buses.com)
 * [Omni Express](http://omniexp.co.il)
 * [Nativ Express](http://nateevexpress.com)

These companies share the technology for realtime bus location updates, which
can be used through their respective websites, and now through TransportDroidIL.
Note that TransportDroidIL takes data intended for
display on Internet Explorer, which isn't under our control and attempts to
display it on your phone. In spite our best effort, this process is prone to
errors, so we can not be responsible if you are late to an important meeting
with your boss...
